# The C++ Examples

<p><IMG src="./img/logo-sun.jpg" border="0" width="180" height="97"></p>
<p>This repository contains several examples and experiments of increasing complexity and difficulty, that may form an (elementary) tutorial about the understanding of the beautiful C++ programming language. Several tests are also based on the new C++11, C++-14, and C++17 standards. Each test has a brief installation and usage manual.<p>

<p>All examples and experiments in this repository are tested with the <A href="https://gcc.gnu.org/"><i>GCC</i></A> under the Ubuntu Linux 16.0.4 (LTS), as well as the <A href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/"><i>Apple XCode</i></A> (based on the <A href="https://clang.llvm.org/"><i>CLANG</i></A> compiler) under the MacOsX 11.* El-Capitan (and higher), and the <A href="https://www.visualstudio.com/"><i>Microsoft Visual Studio (Community Edition 2017)</i></A> under the Microsoft Windows 8.1 (and higher).<p>
  
<p>Their <A href="https://cmake.org"><i>CMAKE</i></A> building infrastructure is provided, as well as the corresponding <A href="https://www.visualstudio.com/"><i>Microsoft Visual Studio (Community Edition 2017)</i></A> solution file, and the <A href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/"><i>Apple XCode</i></A> project file.<p>
